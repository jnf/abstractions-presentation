# Things You Forgot Were Hard
I don't focus on my own understanding of programming anymore. Instead, I spend my time helping others increase their skills. There is _nothing_ intuitive about programming. Sure, there's no magic but that doesn't make those initial, fundamental chasms of abstraction any easier to cross. For many of us, those bridges are well cemented. We've crossed into unconscious competence and we can't recall what it was like to not understand how return values differ from printing to the screen.

## Purpose
I want to better understand how we, as experienced developers, can better support, enable, encourage, and foster students and junior developers.

## Dreyfus Research
I'm not the only person--in this room, even--that's wondered how to do this. Every profession has it's methodology and folklore on how to gain experience and expertise. Some professions that parallel programming well as cooking and nursing.
