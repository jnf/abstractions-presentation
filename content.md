# Things You Forgot Were Hard

## Content Warning: Motion & Color Shifting
If you experience motion sickness or similar, please be aware that in a brief five minutes, I'm gonna move through about ten slides. There's some moving text and colors, plus some shifting colors and patterns.

## Things You Forgot Were Hard
I don't focus on my own understanding of programming anymore. Instead, I spend my time helping others increase their skills. There is _nothing_ intuitive about programming. Sure, there's no magic but that doesn't make those initial, fundamental chasms of abstraction any easier to cross. For many of us, those bridges are well cemented. We've crossed into unconscious competence and we can't recall what it was like to not understand how return values differ from printing to the screen.

## The Purpose of This Discussion
My session isn't a presentation or demonstration. It's a discussion. I've got some talking point to get us going, but primarily I want to hear from you. I want to better understand how we, as experienced developers, can better support, enable, encourage, and foster students and junior developers. My contribution to Open Source isn't in library or tools, but in mentoring and training.

## This Is Me
- 10+ years of professional experience
- Self-taught
- Shipped code in a dozen stacks and languages
- Privileged background
  - social sciences background
  - live in a major city
  - stable living situation
  - right place, right time to enter industry
  - oh, and it helps that I've got ultimate passing privilege in being perceived as a tall, white, cisgendered, heteronormative man

## This Is Us
- A stunning collection of intersections
- Myriad backgrounds, goals, beliefs, and skills
- Many less privileged than myself
- All trying to find our way, do the best we can, care for ourselves, our families, and our communitites

Yinz may have seen the Stack Overflow annual developer report. Not exactly a rigorous study, but it helped me put some numbers to my experience and observations. 

## For Every Ten of Us
If we were to talk to any ten of us, we'd get ten different stories. But there are some broad similarities I'd like to discuss.

## Most of Us Do Not Have a CS Education
The developer survey says most of us came into software development by a means that's not a computer science degree.

## Most of Us Haven't Been Doing This Long
We're a young industry, compared to, say, plumbing or farming. Most of us aren't experienced in terms of total years of industry participation.

## There's Been Research
So what does this mean? Well, how about this:

- Expert staff members working in the trenches aren't always recognized as experts or paid accordingly
- Not all expert staff want to end up as managers
- There's a huge variance in staff members' abilities
- There's a huge variance in managers' abilities
- Any given team likely has members at widely different skill levels and can't be treated as a homogeneous set of replaceable resources

I'm not talking about developers. Those weren't even my words. It was an excerpt from _Pragmatic Thinking and Learning_ from the __Pragamtic Bookshelf__. That's where I first learned about the research conducted by the Dreyfus Brothers (Hubert and Stuart). They wanted to learn how human learn as to better teach computers to learn, so they studied nursing, a field remarkably like programming, except about an order of magnitude more difficult.

## Teaching is a Blended Skill
 >> Empathy, Patience, and Consistency
 
 The model they describe, known as the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition, presents expertise as a gradual transition from novice to expert, concrete to abstract, context-free to context-dependent.

## Let's Discuss
All developers and community memebers are welcome. Everyone has a perspective to contribute. Senior devs, let's talk mentoring approach and strategy and figure out how to grow our empathy as we reach across the experience divide. Junior devs, let's talk about moving through the levels of expertise as defined by the Brothers Dreyfus.
